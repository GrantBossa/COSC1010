# Instructions
# -   Assume a file containing a series of integers is named `numbers.txt` and 
# exists on the computerâ€™s disk. 
#
# -   Write a program that calculates the average of all the numbers stored in the file.
# 
# -   Modify the program that you wrote for `Average of Numbers` so it handles 
# the following exceptions:
# -   It should handle any `IOError` exceptions that are raised when the file 
#  is opened and data is read from it.
#
# -   It should handle any `ValueError` exceptions that are raised when the items 
# that are read from the file are converted to a number.
