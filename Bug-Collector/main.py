# A bug collector collects bugs every day for five days. 
# Write a program that keeps a running total of the number of bugs collected during the five days. 
# The loop should ask for the number of bugs collected for each day, and 
# when the loop is finished, the program should display the total number of bugs collected.
#
# Initialize variables for bugs and total number of bugs collected.
total_running = 0
total_each_day = 0
counter_day = 0

# Get number of bugs collected each day using a for loop.

# Display the total number of bugs collected.
